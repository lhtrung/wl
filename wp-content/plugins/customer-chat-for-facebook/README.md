# Facebook Customer Chat Plugin

I’ve made a plugin for the new Customer Chat Beta so you can try Facebook Messenger on your own website!

Keep in mind Facebook is currently beta testing this.

You can find out more about the beta in [Facebook’s post](https://blog.messengerdevelopers.com/messenger-customer-chat-open-beta-16b11879637)

## Setup & Installation
Since this is a newer experimental plugin it requires some setup to get going.
